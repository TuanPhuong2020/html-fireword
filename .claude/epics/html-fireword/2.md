# Task: Project Setup and Build Configuration

## Description
Initialize the npm package structure, configure Rollup build system with plugins, set up TypeScript definitions, and create the basic project scaffolding for the html-fireword library.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] package.json created with correct metadata (name, version, description, keywords)
- [ ] Rollup configuration file created with UMD, ESM, and CommonJS output formats
- [ ] Rollup plugins installed and configured (terser for minification, node-resolve, commonjs)
- [ ] TypeScript definitions setup (firework.d.ts structure)
- [ ] Project directory structure created (src/, dist/, demo/)
- [ ] npm scripts configured (build, dev, test)
- [ ] .gitignore file with node_modules, dist, .DS_Store
- [ ] README.md skeleton created
- [ ] LICENSE file added (MIT recommended)

## Technical Details
**Implementation Approach:**
- Initialize with `npm init`
- Install dev dependencies:
  - rollup
  - @rollup/plugin-node-resolve
  - @rollup/plugin-commonjs
  - @rollup/plugin-terser
  - typescript (for .d.ts generation)
  - jest (for testing)
- Create rollup.config.js:
  - Input: src/firework.js
  - Output formats: UMD (firework.js, firework.min.js), ESM (firework.esm.js), CommonJS (firework.cjs.js)
  - Plugins: resolve, commonjs, terser (for minified build only)
- Directory structure:
  ```
  html-fireword/
  ├── src/
  │   └── firework.js
  ├── dist/ (generated)
  ├── demo/
  ├── package.json
  ├── rollup.config.js
  ├── README.md
  └── LICENSE
  ```

**Key Considerations:**
- Set "type": "module" in package.json for ESM support
- Configure "main", "module", and "types" fields in package.json
- Ensure build outputs to dist/ folder
- Bundle size monitoring: Add script to check gzipped size

**Code Locations:**
- package.json (new)
- rollup.config.js (new)
- src/firework.js (skeleton)
- src/firework.d.ts (new)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Node.js and npm installed
- [ ] GitHub repository created

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 4-6 hours
- Parallel: true (no dependencies on other tasks)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All files created and committed
- [ ] `npm install` runs successfully
- [ ] `npm run build` executes without errors (even with minimal code)
- [ ] dist/ folder contains all expected output files
- [ ] TypeScript definitions are valid
- [ ] Project structure follows library best practices
