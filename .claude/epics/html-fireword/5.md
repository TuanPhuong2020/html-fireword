# Task: Multi-Firework Support and Accessibility

## Description
Enable simultaneous rendering of multiple fireworks without performance degradation. Implement accessibility features including prefers-reduced-motion support and optional animation disabling.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Support 5-10 simultaneous fireworks maintaining 60fps
- [ ] Multiple launch() calls append particles without clearing existing ones
- [ ] Animation loop continues until all particles from all fireworks fade
- [ ] Detect and respect `prefers-reduced-motion` CSS media query
- [ ] Option to disable animations entirely via constructor
- [ ] Reduced motion mode: Simplified/static celebration (e.g., brief flash)
- [ ] No interference with screen readers or keyboard navigation
- [ ] Performance testing with 10 simultaneous fireworks (250+ particles)

## Technical Details
**Implementation Approach:**
- Multi-firework support via particle array accumulation
- Accessibility: Check prefers-reduced-motion, add reduced motion mode
- Canvas overlay with pointer-events: none and aria-hidden
- Performance stress testing with 500 particles

**Key Considerations:**
- Default behavior respects system preferences
- Developer can override with explicit options
- Reduced motion mode still provides visual feedback
- Performance must not degrade

**Code Locations:**
- src/firework.js (extend existing class)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 003 completed (color system must be in place)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 10-14 hours
- Parallel: false (requires color system from Task 003)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] 10 simultaneous fireworks render at 60fps
- [ ] prefers-reduced-motion detected and respected
- [ ] Reduced motion mode implemented and tested
- [ ] Canvas has proper ARIA attributes
- [ ] Performance validated with stress testing
- [ ] Accessibility tested with screen reader
