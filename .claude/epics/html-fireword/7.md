# Task: Demo Page, Documentation, and npm Publishing

## Description
Create an interactive demo page with examples, write comprehensive documentation (README, API reference, quickstart guide), and publish the library to npm. Set up GitHub Pages for demo hosting.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Demo page created in demo/index.html with live examples
- [ ] Demo shows 3+ usage scenarios (basic, custom colors, event triggers)
- [ ] Demo includes FPS counter for performance visualization
- [ ] README.md with installation, quickstart, and API overview
- [ ] API reference documentation (all methods, options, callbacks)
- [ ] Code examples in documentation are tested and working
- [ ] package.json configured for npm publishing (files, keywords, license)
- [ ] Library published to npm registry
- [ ] GitHub Pages configured to host demo
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md for version tracking

## Technical Details
**Implementation Approach:**
- Demo page structure:
  - demo/index.html - Main demo page
  - demo/styles.css - Demo styling
  - Examples: basic usage, color palette, click triggers, auto-launch
  - FPS counter using requestAnimationFrame timestamp
- Documentation:
  - README.md: Installation, quickstart (5-minute guide), API overview, examples
  - API.md: Detailed method signatures, options, callbacks
  - Code examples tested in demo page
- npm Publishing:
  - Configure package.json: files array (dist/, README.md)
  - Set version to 1.0.0
  - Add keywords: fireworks, animation, canvas, particles, celebration
  - Run `npm publish` after build
- GitHub Pages:
  - Configure repo settings for Pages
  - Point to demo/ folder or create docs/ folder

**Key Considerations:**
- Demo must work from CDN (unpkg/jsdelivr)
- Documentation should enable 15-minute integration (PRD requirement)
- Include bundle size badge in README

**Code Locations:**
- demo/index.html (new)
- demo/styles.css (new)
- README.md (update)
- API.md (new)
- CHANGELOG.md (new)
- package.json (update for publishing)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 005 completed (testing validates everything works)
- [ ] npm account with publish permissions
- [ ] GitHub repository created

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 12-16 hours
- Parallel: false (requires completed, tested library)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Demo page is live and functional
- [ ] All documentation written and reviewed
- [ ] Code examples in docs tested
- [ ] Library published to npm successfully
- [ ] GitHub Pages demo accessible via URL
- [ ] README includes npm install instructions and badges
